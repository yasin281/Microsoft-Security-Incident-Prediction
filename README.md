# Practica APA 2024-Q2

In this repository you will find the code and the report for the machine learning project of the course APA 2024-Q2.
In the src folder there are two notebooks, data folder, models folder and requirements files.

## Src folder
The src folder contains two notebooks:
- `DataPreparation.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code to prepare the data for the project. It includes the data cleaning, feature engineering and data transformation.

- `ModelTraining.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code to train the models for the project. It includes the code to train the models, evaluate the models and save the models.

### Data folder
The data used for the project is Microsoft Incident Prediction dataset available in Kaggle, we used a subset of this dataset. The data folder contains the data used for the project.

### Models folder
The models folder contains the trained models for the project. If in future there is need to use the models, they can be loaded from this folder.

### Requirements
The requirements.txt file contains the libraries needed to run the notebooks.

## How to run the notebooks
1. To run the notebooks you need to install the libraries in the requirements.txt file. This can be done by running the first cell in the notebooks.
2. Run the cells in the `DataPreparation.ipynb` notebook to prepare the data.
3. Run the cells in the `ModelTraining.ipynb` notebook to train the models.
